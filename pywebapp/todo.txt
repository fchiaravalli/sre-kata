Lista di cose che andrebbero ma che essendo un esercizio e non avendo il tempo non faro'


user not root in dockerfile
versioning from git / tag
uwsgi instead of flask?
check shaimage from local to ecr so to push only when something change
variables for the port to be binded

better location of the app code
start the auto deploy after git commit on python 

better tags on every resource to understand the cost/price
ecs and alb not in the same deploy structure?
add iam instance role to ecs task to write logs on cloudwatch


ecs fargate more simple but not in the free tier

ecs with ec2 better if we put a bastion to connect to the ec2 or ssm through console or ssh inside http

iam role for infrastructure user and role for app deploy
