Lista di cose che andrebbero ma che essendo un esercizio e non avendo il tempo non faro'


user not root in dockerfile
versioning from git / tag
uwsgi instead of flask?
check shaimage from local to ecr to be sure that is pushed correctly
use a docker container with SELinux enabled


better location of the app code
start the auto build with also test of the app after git commit on python and after that deploy but only nozapp through a third service inside github or aws or tools like jenkins and bamboo
create a limited user/role to use terragrunt inside nozapp, and use another role to build the infrastructure that does not change
iam role for infrastructure user and role for app deploy

better tags on every resource to understand the cost/price
ecs and alb not in the same deploy structure?

ecs fargate more simple but not in the free tier

ecs with ec2 better if we put a bastion to connect to the ec2 or ssm through console or ssh inside http

better security groups rules, the ec2 does not need to go in internet, etc.

attach an AWS waf on the load balancer

ssl on loadbalancer
